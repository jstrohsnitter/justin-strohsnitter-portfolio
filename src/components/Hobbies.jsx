			<p className="hobbiesP">I’m a water man, and a musician. I love to sail, and surf, and to get outside as much as I can. When the wind is down, and the water is flat, I produce electronic music, and DJ. I have DJ’d around the northeast, and often book shows in Providence, Rhode Island. I’ve loved music my whole life, and enjoy recording samples of the world around me like waves at the beach, birds in the forest, bear bells on a hike, and use them in my music. A few nights a week I play ice hockey with my friends in adult leagues across Rhode Island. Any opportunity to move around and have a good time, I take it!</p>
