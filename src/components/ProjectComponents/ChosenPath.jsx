			<p className="whereToFishP">Here is a simple clicker game I made with Vanilla JS. In this game my aim was to first build a clicker game which was the minimum viable product assigned. In the extra time I had, I began to expand the game making it a choose your own adventure style game, where a user could select a path, add an inventory, and interact with encounters. I got as far as building the store, but you can see that I had a particular focus on styling. The game is fun, has a sense of humor, and involves set-backs when clicking through to keep the user engaged.</p>
