			<h1>A bit about myself...</h1>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Justin Strohsnitter and I am a Web Developer based in Providence, Rhode Island.<br/>
				Through a wide varitey of work and life experiences I have gathered the knowledge to work diligently and efficiently on whatever task is at hand.<br/>
				One of the things that motivates me the most is team synergy. I love working with a team who is driving hard to reach a goal. It profoundly satisfies me.<br/>
				My first experience with the force of a team was on the ice. I started playing ice hockey when I was 4 years old, and continued to play through high school, 
				eventually captaining my varsity team. Throughout my time on the ice, I developed an intuitive knowledge of what it meant for a team to be Performing. 
				When every player on the ice knew their role, where to be at the right time, where to move the puck and how, the group entered a collective flow. 
				This flow is a feeling that has stuck with me. I know it when I am in it. I know it when my team is in it, and when they are not in it. 
				When the team isn't in flow, I know how to get them there. <br/> 
				I took these experiences on the ice, along with my natural apptitude for leadership I learned from my mother, and have been applying them in my personal and professional world ever since.<br/>
				If it sounds like I may be a good fit for your project and team, please feel free to click around to learn more about my life of experiences. Enjoy!
