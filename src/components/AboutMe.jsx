			<h1>A bit about myself...</h1>
			<div className="aboutMe">
			<p>Hi there! My name is Justin Strohsnitter and I am a full-stack engineer based in Providence, Rhode Island. <br/><br/>

I’m well-versed in multiple coding languages, frameworks, and database systems (see Work Experience -> Skills for the full list), and am most interested in projects involving Biotechnology and SQL. I am also open to roles in technical project and product management.<br/><br/>

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I enjoyed a leadership career in the military and the gas utility industry. I find it profoundly satisfying to work on cross-functional teams driving hard to reach a common goal.<br/><br/>

I’m currently open to freelancing and consulting work. If it sounds like I may be a good fit for your project or team, feel free to reach out!
