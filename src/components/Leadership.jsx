			<h1>Who I am as a leader...</h1>
			<p className="leadershipP">Leadership comes naturally to me. I believe a leader is an integral member of a team who is not above the team, but one who sets the direction, and keeps a course. What makes me a great leader is my ability to communicate with others. I lead from the heart. I take time to listen to my team members, getting to know them for who they are, and I tailor my approach to leading per individual (and per team) as required.<br/> 
A common phrase used in military leadership is 'trust but verify'.  In my opinion, this is one of the hardest things to do as a leader. When new to a team, how do you know if something has been done when it is reported as complete? How do you know that a task has been completed to standard? While serving as an officer in the Army National Guard, and as a Gas Construction Supervisor, I was often leading teams whose technical skill sets were outside of my own.  However, this provided me a great opportunity not only to learn something new about the trades in which I was involved, but also to learn more about the technical experts executing the work.  Often, when a team leader (foreman, squad leader, or platoon leader) would report that a task had been completed, I would ask them to explain to me how it was completed. While on site, a team leader would show me the process, break things into components and subtasks, and relay their process.  While hearing them out, I would be internally comparing to the standards necessary, which I held the responsibility of learning in my free time.  This process demonstrates to the subject matter experts that I holistically care about what they say, and what they do.<br/>
I regard the position to lead as an honor and conduct its responsibilities with care and respect.
